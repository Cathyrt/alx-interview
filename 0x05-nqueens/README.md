## 0x05. N Queens

### Description

- The N Queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and involves placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. 
- This repository contains a Python program that solves the N Queens problem and prints all possible solutions.
- The program uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions for the N Queens puzzle. 
- It starts with an empty chessboard and recursively places queens in each row while checking for conflicts with previously placed queens.
- If a valid solution is found, it is stored in a list of solutions.
